Workplace safety in hazardous environments like construction sites and industrial plants is crucial to prevent accidents and injuries. One of the most important safety measures is ensuring workers wear safety helmets, which protect against head injuries from falling objects and machinery. Non-compliance with helmet regulations increases the risk of serious injuries or fatalities, making effective monitoring essential, especially in large-scale operations where manual oversight is prone to errors and inefficiency.

To overcome these challenges, SafeGuard Corp plans to develop an automated image analysis system to detect whether workers are wearing safety helmets. This system will improve safety enforcement, ensuring compliance and reducing the risk of head injuries. By automating helmet monitoring, SafeGuard aims to enhance efficiency, scalability, and accuracy, ultimately fostering a safer work environment while minimizing human error in safety oversight.
Objective
As a data scientist at SafeGuard Corp, you are tasked with developing an image classification model that classifies images into one of two categories:
- With Helmet: Workers wearing safety helmets.
- Without Helmet: Workers not wearing safety helmets.

The ultimate objective is to prepare the model for deployment as part of an automated monitoring system. This system will enable real-time analysis of images and assist in ensuring compliance with workplace safety regulations.
Data Dictionary
The dataset consists of 631 images, equally divided into two categories:

- With Helmet: 311 images showing workers wearing helmets.
- Without Helmet: 320 images showing workers not wearing helmets.

Dataset Characteristics:
- Variations in Conditions: Images include diverse environments such as construction sites, factories, and industrial settings, with variations in lighting, angles, and worker postures to simulate real-world conditions.
- Worker Activities: Workers are depicted in actions such as standing, using tools, or moving, ensuring robust model learning for various scenarios.
